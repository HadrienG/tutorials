Welcome!

This website is a collection of Bioinformatics tutorials that I've accumulated over the years, while teaching a bioinformatics course at the [Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences](https://www.slu.se) and during various bioinformatics workshops around the globe.

Feel free to follow them online, or to use and modify them for your own teaching.
